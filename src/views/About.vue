            <p>News is at the heart of what we do. We are driven by the need to make news serve people better, because a healthy society needs a healthy news diet. YikNews exists to facilitate this, by publishing headlines linking to breaking and curated news from a diverse range of credible, independent and public interest news sources. On the platform, people can discover news piblications, weigh up differing presentations of the facts and viewpoints, and challenge their preconceptions, all is they make up their own minds. We believe this helps make society better, but huge challenges remain. We must urgently move towards a future where public interest news and journalism is effectievely funded by - and distributed for - the people it serves.</p>
